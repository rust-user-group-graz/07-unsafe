## Prologue: Is UTF-8 robust w.r.t. to bit flips?

Consider the following [contrived] notion of robustness.

> Let {X} be a valid UTF-8 string. Is [A, {X}, A] a valid UTF-8 string if one arbitrary bit flip occurs?

---

## Prologue: Is UTF-8 robust w.r.t. to bit flips?

```rust
// Consider a byte array like [0b1000001, 0b11110xxx,
// 0b10xxxxxx, 0b10xxxxxx, 0b10xxxxxx, 0b1000001]
// where x denote arbitrary bits.
// Continue only if the array is a valid UTF-8 string.
// Now introduce one arbitrary bit flip in any bit of
// the 4 mid bytes. Does it give a valid UTF-8 string?
// Returns the total number of tests and invalid strings.
```

---

## Prologue: Is UTF-8 robust w.r.t. to bit flips?

```rust
fn flips_in_4_bytes() -> (u64, u64) {
  let mut total = 0u64;
  let mut invalid = 0u64;

  let mut text = [
    'A' as u8,
    0b1111_0000u8, 0b10_000000,
    0b10_000000, 0b10_000000,
    'A' as u8,
  ];
  // TODO next slide

  (total, invalid)
}
```

---

## Prologue: Is UTF-8 robust w.r.t. to bit flips?

```rust
// base gives x-values in 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
for base in 0..=2097152u32 {
  // bit_flip defines the index of the bit to flip
  for bit_flip in 0..32 {
    text[1] = 0b1111_0000 | (base & 0b111) as u8;
    text[2] = 0b1000_0000 | ((base >> 3) & 0b0011_1111) as u8;
    text[3] = 0b1000_0000 | ((base >> 9) & 0b0011_1111) as u8;
    text[4] = 0b1000_0000 | ((base >> 15) & 0b0011_1111) as u8;
    if str::from_utf8(&text).is_err() {
      continue
    }
    // TODO next slide
    total += 1;
  }
}
```

---

## Prologue: Is UTF-8 robust w.r.t. to bit flips?

```rust
      // apply bit flip
      if bit_flip < 8 {
        text[1] = text[1] ^ (1 << bit_flip);
      } else if bit_flip < 16 {
        text[2] = text[2] ^ (1 << (bit_flip - 8));
      } else if bit_flip < 24 {
        text[3] = text[3] ^ (1 << (bit_flip - 16));
      } else {
        text[4] = text[4] ^ (1 << (bit_flip - 24));
      }
      match str::from_utf8(&text) {
        Ok(_) => {},
        Err(_) => invalid += 1,
      };
```

## Prologue: Is UTF-8 robust w.r.t. to bit flips?

Is `[A, {X}, A]` a valid UTF-8 string if one arbitrary bit flip occurs? Yes, with 61.6 % chance.

> The following code is unsound:

## Issue #83 excerpts

@fafhrd91

> This is internal code. There is no repeated call to get_mut() anywhere in code

Closes issue.

@fafhrd91

> Please, don‚Äôt start

---

## Issue #83 excerpts

@Shnatsel

> These two references *do not need to exist in the same function* to trigger undefined behavior, they only need to exist at the same point in time.
An easy way to see if this is a problem in practice is replace .as_ref() with .get_mut().unwrap() and see if anything panics.

## Issue #83 excerpts

@cdbattags

# Dialogue: unsafe rust

---

## `unsafe`

See [Unsafe Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html) section in the Rust book and [nomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/meet-safe-and-unsafe.html).

1. Is a keyword in rust: `unsafe { let a = 42; }`
2. Applies to blocks of code, incl. functions, traits.
3. Does not turn off borrow checker or alike
4. Semantics are basic: Some responsibilities move from rust to the programmer!

---

## `unsafe` rationale

1. *Static analysis is conservative*. When the compiler tries to determine whether or not code upholds the guarantees, it‚Äôs better for it to reject some valid programs rather than accept some invalid programs.
2. *The underlying computer hardware is inherently unsafe*. Optimizations sometimes requires breaking strong guarantees.

---

## `unsafe` superpowers

1. Dereference a raw pointer
2. Call an unsafe function or method
3. Access or modify a mutable static variable
4. Implement an unsafe trait
5. Access fields of unions

---

## Raw pointers

‚Üí does not require unsafe rust. But we can‚Äôt dereference raw pointers outside an unsafe block.

1. Are allowed to ignore the borrowing rules by having both immutable and mutable pointers or multiple mutable pointers to the same location
2. Aren‚Äôt guaranteed to point to valid memory
3. Are allowed to be null
4. Don‚Äôt implement any automatic cleanup

---

## In practice: raw pointers

```rust
fn main() {
    let addr = 0x00;
    let ptr = addr as *const i32;
    println!("{}", *ptr);
}
```

`ptr` is a raw pointer. Does it compile?

---

    they can violate aliasing rules and cause data races:
    all of these are undefined behavior

```

---

## In practice

```rust
fn main() {
    let addr = 0x00;
    let ptr = addr as *const i32;
    unsafe {
        println!("{}", *ptr);
    }
}
```

unsafe fn deref() {
    let addr = 0x00;

    println!("{}", *ptr);
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        deref();
    }
}
```

If `unsafe` block is omitted, ‚Äúcall to unsafe function is unsafe and requires unsafe function or block‚Äù

---

## In practice: `mut` static variable

```rust
static MY_INT: u64 = 42;
  
fn main() {
    println!("{}", MY_INT);
}
```

‚Üí type specifier is required

## Do I see unsafe rust in the documentation?

Yes, because you need to call it unsafely.

Example: [Rc::assume_init](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html#method.assume_init)

## So, how to consider unsafe rust?

## Compiler guarantees

<img src="img/safety_dance.png" alt="Safety dance isn't about eliminating all unsafe code. It's about auditing all unsafe code for correctness. However, if you reduce the amount of unsafe code it obviously doesn't need to be audited any more. That is why reducing the amount of unsafe code helps the goal of auditing. Less unsafe code means less unsafe code to audit." alt="Safety dance" />
